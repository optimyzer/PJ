PJ is operated by the Optimysis Inc. d/b/a PainterJunction.com ("PainterJunction.com", "us" or "we").<br>
				This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose information from visitors of PJ ("you"). By using PJ and submitting information on the Site, you agree to our use, collection and disclosure of your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy becomes effective as of the "Last Updated" date specified below.<br>
				<br>
				<span class="ssmHd" style="line-height:normal">How Your Information Is Collected</span><br>
				<br>
				<b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b>You are not required to provide your personally identifiable information when you visit PJ. However, in order to obtain information, including quotes from Painting Service providers ("Vendors"), you must fill out and submit a quote request form containing personally identifiable information including without limitation your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, and information pertaining to your Painting Service needs (a "Quote Request").<br>
				<br>
				<b>Passive Information:</b> PJ automatically collects information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following: </p>
				<div align="justify">
					<ul>
					  <li><b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by our computers (or servers) to identify your computer.<br>
						<br>
					  </li>
					  <li><b>IP Address Logs:</b> We also log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, i.e., the location of your computer on the Internet.<br>
						<br>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					We use cookies to recognize you when you visit PJ, to personalize your experience and generally serve you better. The information collected by these technical means is aggregated and anonymous and shall be referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Usage Data." You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser and/or with third-party software packages.<br>
					<br>
					<span class="ssmHd" style="line-height:normal">How Your Information Is Used</span><br>
					<br>
					<b>Our Use of Your Information:</b> The information in your Quote Request and Usage Data may be stored on our servers, our computers, or as cookies on your computer. This information may be used to compile aggregate data that is not personally identifiable and may be used internally or shared with third parties in an aggregate, non-identifiable format.<br>
					<br>
					We may also use the information you provide in your Quote Request to (i) contact you about your satisfaction with PJ, whether you obtained Painting Services from any Vendor through PJ, the identity of any such Vendor, and your satisfaction with the Services provided by such Vendor, and (ii) to send you information and promotional messages about our products and services, or the products or services that we offer on this Site or on our other websites.<br>

					<b>Third Party Use of Your Information:</b> We will not share any of the personally identifiable information provided in a Quote Request with any third party except in the following circumstances:<br>

						<li>If you submit a Quote Request, we will share your information with selected Vendors who may be able to provide Painting Services to you. Although Vendors have agreed to protect your personally identifiable information pursuant to privacy standards which are at as least restrictive as the terms of this Privacy Policy, we do not and cannot control the use of your information after it is transmitted to the Vendor and cannot guarantee that the Vendor will not disclose, sell or use your information in a manner that you do not anticipate.

If you opt-in to avail any of such services or submit a new quote request for any such product or service, we shall share your information with selected vendors  who may be able to provide such services to you. After we share your information with such third-party marketers, we do not and cannot control the third-party marketers' subsequent use or disclosure of your information and cannot guarantee that they will not disclose, sell or use your information in a manner that you do not anticipate. You therefore must contact the third-party marketers if you have any questions or concerns regarding their use of your information.<br>
						<br>
						</li>
						<li>If we receive a subpoena or other request to disclose your information in accordance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we will disclose your information in accordance therewith.<br>
							 <br>
						</li>
						<li>If we receive an inquiry from a bona-fide rights owner in connection with allegations of infringement of copyright or other proprietary rights arising from information you have submitted on PJ or otherwise provided to us, we will disclose your information in response to any such inquiries.<br>
							<br>
						</li>
						<li>If we are acquired by, merge with, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to a third party, we will disclose and/or transfer your information to that third party.<br>
							<br>
						</li>
					</ul>
