			<h2>Painting Quotes</h2>

			<p>This is exactly why we created PainterJunction to make it super easy to get painting quotes.</p>

			<p><i>But is there anything you should do before requesting quotes for your painting job?</i></p>
			<p>Let’s take a look ..</p>
			<h3>What to do before getting a painting quote?</h3>
			<p>Just before you request for Free Painting Quotes, draw a simple checklist of what you need a painter for. For instance, if you’re looking to paint the exterior part of your home, specify what you want the painter to paint, e.g. a play house, exterior walls etc</p>
			<p>Also, if you need a fresh coat of paint on any interior part of your home like your kitchen, living room, dining space etc. put them down in writing and list them as part of the services you require when you’re requesting for free painting quotes. </p>
			
			<p>Once you make up your mind on what you intend to paint, hiring the right painter for the job and at the right cost becomes easier. This is because you’ll be able to tell the painter exactly what you want and how you want it.</p>
			
			<p>Being able to communicate what you want to painters will not only make it easier for you to get an accurate estimate, it also makes it easier for painters to do your job brilliantly. </p>
			
			
		<p>** Pro Tip: Pay attention to minor details like window trims and crown moldings. A lot of times these can be overlooked and later cause confusion. **</p>

			<h3>What to look for in a painter?</h3>
			
			<p>Here are telltale signs to look out for before hiring any painter:</p>
			<ul class="ul_list number_list">
				<li>
					<b>License</b>
					<p>Professional painters have the right credentials to do their jobs. Just before you hire any painter any residential or commercial painting service, request for their license. If the painter can’t provide one, you’re probably dealing with a rogue painter or a quack.</p>

					<p>At Painter Junction, all our painters are prescreened to ensure they have the right skills, experience and credentials to handle both residential and commercial painting services at the highest level.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Experience</b>
					<p>Do not make the mistake of hiring an inexperienced painter who will end up experimenting with your job. Professional painters know exactly how to do their jobs to get the best result possible. </p>
					<p>They know the right tool to use at every phase of their painting jobs and the type of paint and materials required to do the job the right way.</p>
				</li>

				<li>	
					<b>References</b>
					<p>Professional painters have a track record of top-quality services and they are always excited to provide references of previous jobs. Just before you hire any painter, request for some references. </p>
					<p>If the painter cannot provide any or if you’re not satisfied with the references, consider other options.  You can’t be too careful!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Pictures from Previous Jobs</b>
					<p>Professional painters always have several pictures from previous jobs to show to clients. Pro painters are always excited to flaunt such pictures at the slightest opportunity. </p>

					<p>So just before you hire any painter, request for pictures from their previous jobs. Seeing such pictures will give you the perfect opportunity to know what to expect if you hire the painter. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Bonded and Insured</b>
					<p>Painting contractors are required to be bonded and insured. Before you hire any painter, ask if they are bonded and insured and find out if the documents they produce are genuine. </p>

					<b>Free Quotes</b>
					<p>Pro painters provide free quotes so you can compare their costs and quality of services with others. At Painter Junction, all you have to do is request for Free Painting Quotes and we will send them your way instantly!</p>

					<h3>How Can You Tell If Your Painting Quote Is Accurate?</h3>

					<p>To ensure that you have an accurate painting quote, provide as much information as possible about your job and what you expect.</p>
					<p>Make sure the painting contractor you’re planning to hire writes everything about your job’s scope and provides a quote that indicates all extra and hidden charges.</p>
