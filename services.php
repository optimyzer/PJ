			<h3>Searching For Self Storage Units? Here's Everything You Need to Know</h3>
			<p>Whether you're moving into a home that isn't quite ready yet or downsizing for a period of time, you need a place to store some of your stuff-and a friend's garage isn't going to cut it.</p>

			<p>Thankfully, self-storage companies exist to help out in exactly these situations.</p>
			<p>At it's basic, self-storage allows you to store your belongings for a small monthly fee. The units come in various shapes and sizes depending on how much you'd like to pace inside. Plus, there's no need to sweat security since the units are completely private-meaning that your self-storage unit is locked and only you hold the key.</p>
			<p>So, what do you need to know before shopping around for self storage quotes?<br>
			To help you shop around for the perfect storage, we'll take a look at the most important factor to consider before comparing storage unit quotes: Which kind of storage best fits your needs.
			</p>
			<h3>Which Type of Storage Option Best Fits Your Needs?</h3>
			<p>If you're new to storage units, you might think that they're all one in the same. However, there are actually three different types of storage to choose from and, depending on your situation, there's certain to be one that stands out as the best fit.</p>
			<h4>Short Term self-storage: Best for Local Moves, Downsizing, and Clearing Out Clutter</h4>
			<p>Standard self-storage is what you typically think of as a storage unit. These are private units available in multiple sizes that you can rent short-term.</p>

			<p>This type of storage, also called mini-storage, is charged on a monthly basis and the storage spaces range in size. You provide your own lock, which can ensure you that your space isn't being accessed without your permission.</p>
			<p>What's the biggest benefit of self-storage units? Unlike the other two options, this situation gives you the ability to access what's in your storage unit at any given time, adding and removing items as you see fit.</p>
			<p>Granted, whether or not you're allowed 24/ 7 entry varies between different self-storage facilities. But, whether they're only open during business hours or allow access at any time night or day, standard self-storage means that you can tuck away seasonal decorations and clothing, large pieces of furniture that just don't fit in your new home, or anything else you don't want to take up space in your living areas without the worry that you won't be able to access them when needed.</p>
